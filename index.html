        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Matt and I'm passionate about making music and developing software. Learning to program has given me a unique opportunity to pursue my interests and communicate technical ideas with others. My journey in tech started as a teenager, when I was playing around with HTML on Black Planet, Angelfire, and Myspace; adding music and images to my profiles. I would later get stuck on learning CSS and PHP with little success. My hobby shifted to music and songwriting which has contributed to my creative skills.<br><br>
            
            After a decade-long break, I rediscovered my love for technology and started learning to code through free resources like YouTube and CodeAcademy. I then moved on to Sololearn, where I found it easy to learn the basics of Python. After completing the Python course, I revisited HTML and CSS (now HTML5 and CSS3) through dedicated courses on each topic and was pleasantly surprised at how much of my early knowledge had stuck with me.<br><br>

            Since 2015, I've been constantly learning about technology, programming languages, platforms, and web-based tools. I have a curious and creative mindset, and love the challenge of building and fixing things. In addition to tech, I also have a passion for music and writing, which now enhances my problem-solving skills and resourcefulness.<br><br>

            One of the highlights of my tech journey was attending the LaunchCode "LC101 - JavaScript & Java Web Development Course" (now called "Part-Time Web Dev"). The course was challenging but incredibly rewarding, as I worked with other students and built real projects, including front-end pages that interacted with back-end code and databases. I was thrilled to have completed the course and even landed an opportunity just before graduation.<br><br>

            I have continued learning both on my own and through work, and have discovered that I thrive in structured learning environments. I find it easier to focus when working alone, but also love the energy and ideas that come from working with others.<br><br>

            Currently, I am enrolled in Meta's Front-End Developer course and am enjoying the self-paced nature of the program. My past experiences, including my early tech background, coding bootcamp, and full-time tech work (currently in E-Commerce SaaS), have given me a solid foundation to build upon, and this course will add even more tools to my existing skill set. <br><br>

            Stay tuned for updates, as I plan to use my new skills to improve this bio page. More to come soon!
